### Prompt 5: AI Difficulty System Implementation
**Intent**: Add three difficulty levels for AI gameplay: Easy, Normal (current), and Expert modes with different behavioral patterns.
**Implementation**:
- **Three AI Difficulty Levels**: Easy (relaxed), Normal (balanced), Expert (challenging)
- **Difficulty Selection UI**: Interactive menu between game mode and aesthetic selection
- **Dynamic AI Behavior**: Speed, reaction time, and prediction capabilities vary by difficulty
- **Easy Mode**: 30% slower movement, larger reaction zone, occasional hesitation
- **Normal Mode**: Current balanced AI behavior maintained as baseline
- **Expert Mode**: 30% faster movement, predictive ball tracking, smaller reaction zone
- **Updated Navigation Flow**: Game Mode → Difficulty (AI only) → Physics Mode → Aesthetics → Game
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded difficulty buttons with descriptive labels
- **Label Updates**: AI difficulty shown in game UI (e.g., "AI (Expert)")

### Prompt 6: Dramatic Physics Mode Implementation
**Intent**: Add a physics mode selection system allowing players to choose between classic "Soft" physics and enhanced "Dramatic" physics for more dynamic gameplay with powerful ball effects.
**Implementation**:
- **Two Physics Modes**: Soft (classic Pong physics) and Dramatic (enhanced ball effects)
- **Global Parameter**: Physics mode affects entire game session until restart
- **Physics Mode Selection UI**: Added between difficulty/game mode and aesthetic selection
- **Enhanced Ball Physics**: Dramatic mode features stronger paddle influence, higher speeds, and movement-based effects
- **Dramatic Mode Features**:
  - 50% stronger angle effects (hitPoint multiplier: 6 vs 3)
  - Higher initial speeds (7/5 vs 5/3) and maximum speed (18 vs 12)  
  - Paddle movement influence (40% vs 10% movement transfer)
  - Enhanced edge hits (60% power bonus vs 70% threshold, was 35%)
  - Faster ball acceleration (18% vs 5% speed increase per hit)
- **Updated Navigation Flow**: Game Mode → Difficulty (AI only) → Physics Mode → Aesthetics → Game
- **Visual Indicators**: Distinct button designs with emojis and physics descriptions
- **Session Persistence**: Physics mode maintained throughout game until manual restart

### Prompt 7: Laser Bullet System Implementation
**Intent**: Add a strategic laser bullet system available in all game modes, allowing players and AI to shoot bullets that can deflect the ball or temporarily disable opponent paddles.
**Implementation**:
- **Universal Feature**: Available in all game modes (AI and Player vs Player)
- **Laser Bullet Mechanics**: Bullets travel at double the current ball speed
- **Ball Deflection**: Bullets hitting the ball change its direction
- **Paddle Stunning**: Bullets hitting opponent paddles freeze movement for 0.1 seconds
- **Firing Conditions**: Can only fire after paddle hit and before ball crosses midfield
- **Control Scheme**: Left player uses X key, right player uses C key, AI decides strategically
- **Visual Effects**: Laser bullets with appropriate theme-based colors and effects
- **Strategic Timing**: Adds tactical depth requiring timing and positioning skills
- **AI Intelligence**: AI analyzes optimal firing moments based on ball trajectory and position

### Key Technical Decisions Made:

1. **Rendering Engine**: HTML5 Canvas API for 2D graphics
2. **Game Loop**: RequestAnimationFrame for smooth 60 FPS gameplay
3. **Input Handling**: Event listeners for keyboard controls (WASD/Arrow keys)
4. **Physics**: Custom collision detection and ball physics with acceleration
5. **AI Logic**: Predictive paddle movement with intentional imperfection for balanced gameplay
6. **Responsive Design**: CSS media queries and adaptive canvas sizing
7. **Visual Effects**: CSS animations, glow effects, and dynamic theme system
8. **Theme Architecture**: Modular theme object structure for easy extensibility
9. **Color Management**: Centralized palette system with real-time application
10. **AI Difficulty System**: Variable speed, reaction time, and predictive capabilities
11. **Behavioral AI Logic**: Different movement patterns and accuracy levels per difficulty
12. **Physics Mode System**: Toggle between classic and enhanced ball physics
13. **Dynamic Ball Physics**: Variable collision effects and speed parameters based on mode
14. **Laser Bullet System**: Strategic projectile mechanics with ball deflection and paddle stunning
